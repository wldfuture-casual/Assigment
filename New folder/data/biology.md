# Biology Study Notes - Cellular Biology

## Cell Structure

Cells are the fundamental units of life. They can be classified into two main types:

**Prokaryotic Cells:**
- Lack a membrane-bound nucleus
- Found in bacteria and archaea
- DNA is located in the nucleoid region
- Simpler structure with fewer organelles
- Generally smaller (1-10 micrometers)

**Eukaryotic Cells:**
- Have a true nucleus with a nuclear membrane
- Found in animals, plants, fungi, and protists
- Complex internal membrane systems
- Contain specialized organelles
- Larger and more complex (10-100 micrometers)

## Major Organelles

### Nucleus
The nucleus is the control center of the eukaryotic cell. It contains the cell's genetic material (DNA) organized into chromosomes. The nuclear envelope is a double membrane with nuclear pores that regulate molecular traffic between the nucleus and cytoplasm.

### Mitochondria
Often called the "powerhouse of the cell," mitochondria are responsible for cellular respiration. They convert glucose and oxygen into ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the cell's primary energy currency. Mitochondria have their own DNA and can self-replicate.

### Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)
The ER is a network of membranes involved in protein and lipid synthesis:
- **Rough ER:** Studded with ribosomes, synthesizes proteins
- **Smooth ER:** Lacks ribosomes, produces lipids and detoxifies substances

### Golgi Apparatus
The Golgi apparatus modifies, packages, and distributes proteins and lipids. It receives materials from the ER, processes them, and ships them to their final destinations in vesicles.

### Lysosomes
Lysosomes contain digestive enzymes that break down cellular waste, damaged organelles, and foreign materials. They function as the cell's recycling center.

### Chloroplasts (Plant Cells Only)
Chloroplasts are the sites of photosynthesis in plant cells. They contain chlorophyll, the green pigment that captures light energy to produce glucose from carbon dioxide and water.

## Cell Membrane

The cell membrane (plasma membrane) is a selectively permeable barrier that controls what enters and exits the cell. It consists of:

- **Phospholipid Bilayer:** Two layers of phospholipids with hydrophilic heads facing outward and hydrophobic tails facing inward
- **Proteins:** Embedded throughout for transport, recognition, and signaling
- **Cholesterol:** Provides membrane stability and fluidity
- **Carbohydrates:** Attached to proteins and lipids for cell recognition

### Transport Mechanisms

**Passive Transport (No Energy Required):**
- Diffusion: Movement from high to low concentration
- Osmosis: Diffusion of water across a membrane
- Facilitated diffusion: Using protein channels

**Active Transport (Energy Required):**
- Sodium-potassium pump
- Endocytosis: Cell engulfs materials
- Exocytosis: Cell expels materials

## Cellular Respiration

Cellular respiration is the process by which cells convert glucose into ATP. It occurs in three main stages:

1. **Glycolysis:** Breaks down glucose into pyruvate in the cytoplasm (produces 2 ATP)
2. **Krebs Cycle:** Occurs in mitochondrial matrix (produces 2 ATP)
3. **Electron Transport Chain:** In inner mitochondrial membrane (produces ~34 ATP)

Total ATP yield per glucose molecule: approximately 38 ATP

## Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy in plants, algae, and some bacteria.

**Light-Dependent Reactions (Thylakoid Membranes):**
- Capture light energy using chlorophyll
- Split water molecules (photolysis)
- Produce ATP and NADPH
- Release oxygen as a byproduct

**Light-Independent Reactions / Calvin Cycle (Stroma):**
- Use ATP and NADPH from light reactions
- Fix carbon dioxide into organic molecules
- Produce glucose (C6H12O6)

Overall equation: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2

## Cell Division

### Mitosis
Mitosis produces two identical daughter cells for growth and repair. Phases:
1. **Prophase:** Chromatin condenses into chromosomes
2. **Metaphase:** Chromosomes align at the cell's equator
3. **Anaphase:** Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles
4. **Telophase:** Nuclear membranes reform around each set of chromosomes
5. **Cytokinesis:** Cytoplasm divides, creating two cells

### Meiosis
Meiosis produces four non-identical gametes (sex cells) with half the chromosome number:
- **Meiosis I:** Homologous chromosomes separate (reductional division)
- **Meiosis II:** Sister chromatids separate (similar to mitosis)

Crossing over during Meiosis I increases genetic variation.

## DNA and Protein Synthesis

**DNA Structure:**
- Double helix composed of nucleotides
- Four bases: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C)
- Complementary base pairing: A-T and G-C

**Transcription:**
- DNA is copied into mRNA in the nucleus
- RNA polymerase reads the DNA template strand
- mRNA carries genetic information to ribosomes

**Translation:**
- mRNA is read by ribosomes in the cytoplasm
- tRNA brings amino acids to the ribosome
- Amino acids are linked to form proteins
- Codon (3 bases) specifies each amino acid
